# kick-start-angular
A quick start template for my mean stack projects.

<h2>kick-start-angular</h2>

<h4>Why I am wasting my time here</h4>
<p>This is my own implementation of mean to quick start angular projects. I liked mean.io concept but they seems like to opinionated </p>
<p>Being opiniated is not a bad thing, but its hides too much implementation details and when the project has some critical bugs it is hard to get them resolved</p>


<h2>Running the project</h2>
<p>This project use mixture of npm/bower/gulp and my own script to get it running</p>

<li>Install nodejs version 6.X or above (as I have used ES6 type scripting for node components)</li>
</p>
